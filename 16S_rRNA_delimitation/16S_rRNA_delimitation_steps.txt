# 16S rRNA delimitation steps

### Step 1: Organizing the 16S rRNA sequences

In this step, we will collect all the 16S rRNA sequences and rename them for traceability purposes. Each sequence will be assigned a unique identifier based on the strain name.

#### Scripts:

''' bash
#!/bin/bash

# Create a directory for reformatted 16S sequences
mkdir -p 16S_all_reformatted

# Loop through all FASTA files in the 16S_seq directory
for file in 16S_seq/*.fasta; do
    base=$(basename "$file" .fasta)  # Get the strain name

    # Renaming the 16S sequences and outputting them into the 16S_all_reformatted folder
    awk -v strain="$base" '
        /^>/ {++i; print ">"strain"_copy"i}
        !/^>/ {print}
    ' "$file" > "16S_all_reformatted/${base}.fasta"
done
'''

### Step 2: Concatenate all reformatted sequences
After renaming all the sequences, we need to concatenate them into a single file for alignment and further analysis.

#### Script:

''' bash
#!/bin/bash
cat 16S_all_reformatted/*.fasta > 16S_all_final.fasta
'''

### Step 3: Align all sequences with MAFFT

Now that the sequences are in a single file, we will align them using MAFFT to ensure the sequences are comparable for the delimitation process.

#### Script:
#!/bin/bash
mafft --auto 16S_all_final.fasta > 16S_all_aligned.fasta
'''

### Step 4: Run ABGD for delimitation

With the aligned sequences, we can now run ABGD to perform the delimitation of species.

#### Command:

'''bash
./abgd -a -o ~/Desktop/article1/abgd_output_all/ -d JC69 ~/Desktop/article1/16S_all_aligned.fasta
'''

### Step 5: Run ASAP for delimitation

Finally, we run ASAP for further species delimitation using the same aligned sequences.

#### Command:

'''bash
./asap -a -o ~/Desktop/article1/16s_analysis/asap_output_nographics ~/Desktop/article1/16s_analysis/16S_all_aligned.fasta
'''

## Additional Notes:

- Directory Setup: Ensure that your 16S_seq folder contains all the FASTA files for the 16S rRNA sequences.
- Dependencies: You will need to have MAFFT, ABGD, and ASAP installed and accessible in your environment.
