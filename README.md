This project focuses on species delimitation using genetic sequence data. The methods used for species delineation in this project are ASAP and ABGD, both of which rely on genetic distances to group strains into species. The project progresses from working with the 16S rRNA gene to core genes and then to a gene-per-gene analysis (GPG), using each gene to generate species delimitation results. This GPG approach allows for a much finer classification of bacterial strains, especially when traditional methods like 16S rRNA are not enough. This analysis is critical in microbiology, especially for understanding the diversity of bacterial species.
